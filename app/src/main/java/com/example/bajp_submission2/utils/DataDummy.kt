                "After Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for murder and reveals his identity as Spider-Man,[N 1] Parker, his girlfriend MJ, best friend Ned Leeds, and aunt May are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Parker's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Parker, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Parker goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange suggests a spell that would make everyone forget Parker is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Parker repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories. Strange contains the spell to stop it and makes Parker leave.\n" +

                        "Parker tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider MJ and Ned's applications, but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius rips Parker's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Parker to disable them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Parker back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains that before he was able to contain the corrupted spell it summoned some people from other universes who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they are able to locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko.\n" +

While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize that they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths.[N 2] Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Parker argues that they should first cure the villains' powers and insanity to prevent their deaths upon their return. Parker steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment. He cures Octavius, but Osborn's Goblin persona takes control and convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Parker that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".",

                "TForced by an armed conflict to flee her home, a young Alma Madrigal loses her husband Pedro but saves her triplet infant children: Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. By a \"miracle,\" her candle attains magical qualities, blasts away their pursuers, and creates a sentient house, the Casita, for them to live in, along with a magical hidden town bordered by tall surrounding mountains—an encanto. Fifty years later, the candle continues to burn and the town thrives under its protection. The candle's magic grants superhuman abilities to each Madrigal child, which they use to serve the villagers. However, Bruno, vilified for his gift of precognition, disappeared ten years earlier. Meanwhile, Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, is treated differently for mysteriously not having received a gift.\n" +

She suddenly sees the Casita cracking and the candle's flame flickering, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita appears undamaged to the others. She resolves to save the miracle's magic. The next day, she talks to her super-strong older sister, Luisa, who suggests that Bruno's room, in a forbidden tower in the Casita, may hold clues to the phenomenon. There, Mirabel discovers a cave and recovers pieces of a slab of opaque emerald glass, which forms an image of herself being the cause of the failing magic. After Mirabel narrowly escapes the cave, Luisa discovers that her gift is weakening.\n" +

Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores, who possesses superhuman hearing, blurts out that she overheard Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno's vision. The Casita begins to crack again, causing everyone's powers to go haywire, ruining the night and Mariano's proposal when Pepa inadvertently conjures a downpour. As everyone flees the chaos, Mirabel follows a group of rats and discovers a secret passage behind a portrait. There she encounters Bruno, who reveals that his vision of Mirabel could have put her at odds with the family—so he broke the vision and went into hiding to protect her, concealing himself within the house's walls so he could still be near them. At Mirabel's urging, he reluctantly conjures another vision, which shows the Casita's inevitable destruction and an image of Mirabel embracing a young woman, whom they identify as Isabela.",
