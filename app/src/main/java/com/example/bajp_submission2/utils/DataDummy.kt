After Parker, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Parker goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help.

As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Parker back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors.

While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize that they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths.[N 2] Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Parker argues that they should first cure the villains' powers and insanity to prevent their deaths upon their return. Parker steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment. He cures Octavius, but Osborn's Goblin persona takes control and convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Parker that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".",

At Mirabel's urging, he reluctantly conjures another vision, which shows the Casita's inevitable destruction and an image of Mirabel embracing a young woman, whom they identify as Isabela.",

                "Intelligence officer Amanda Waller assembles two Task Force X (Suicide Squad) teams, comprising Belle Reve penitentiary inmates who agree to carry out a mission in exchange for lighter sentences. Sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese after its government is overthrown by an anti-American regime, the squads are tasked with destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim, which holds the secretive experiment \"Project Starfish\". One team, led by Colonel Rick Flag, is almost entirely wiped out by the Corto Maltese military upon landing. This allows the other team, led by mercenary Bloodsport and consisting of Peacemaker, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and Ratcatcher 2, to enter the country undetected.\n" +

Meanwhile, first team survivor Harley Quinn is taken captive by the Corto Maltese government and learns of the new regime's plans to use Project Starfish against other nations. The squad captures the Thinker, the lead scientist in charge of Project Starfish, and are joined by Harley after she escapes from the government. They break into Jötunheim with the Thinker's help and begin to rig the facility with explosives. Flag and Ratcatcher 2 enter the underground Project Starfish laboratory with the Thinker.\n" +

                        "Flag and Ratcatcher 2 discover that Project Starfish is Starro the Conqueror, a giant alien starfish that creates smaller versions of itself to kill people and control their bodies. The Thinker reveals that Starro was brought to Earth by the U.S. government, which has secretly funded the experiments for decades using thousands of Corto Maltese citizens as test subjects. An enraged Flag decides to leak a hard drive containing evidence but is killed by Peacemaker, who is under orders from Waller to cover up the U.S.'s involvement. Meanwhile, a skirmish between the Squad and the Corto Maltese military leads to Polka-Dot Man accidentally setting off the explosives prematurely. As Jötunheim crumbles, Ratcatcher 2 steals the drive and Peacemaker attempts to execute her. Bloodsport saves her by shooting Peacemaker, and takes the drive.\n" +

Waller tells the squad that their mission is complete, but Bloodsport leads the squad to fight Starro against her orders; Waller's subordinates prevent her from executing them. Starro kills Polka-Dot Man, Harley pierces a hole in its eye, and Ratcatcher 2 summons the city's rats to chew Starro to death from the inside. With the military diverted, Soria takes control of the government and pledges democratic elections. Bloodsport forces Waller to release him and the surviving squad members in exchange for keeping the contents of the drive confidential, and the squad is airlifted out of Corto Maltese. In a post-credits scene, Waller punishes her subordinates by assigning them to a new mission with Peacemaker, who is recovering in a hospital.",

Starring Academy and Emmy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner Angela Bassett (“American Horror Story,” “What’s Love Got to Do with It”), the series is based on the real-life, high-pressure experiences of emergency response providers who are thrust into heart-stopping situations that are equal parts unpredictable, intense and uplifting. These emergency responders must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in their own lives.
